Having a variety of great tools at your disposal isn’t helpful if you don’t know which one you really need, what each tool is useful for, and how they all work. In this course learn the inner workings of neural networks, so that you're able to work more effectively with machine learning tools. Instructor Eduardo Corpeño helps you learn by example by providing a series of exercises in Python to help you to grasp what’s going on inside. Discover how to relate parts of a biological neuron to Python elements, which allows you to make a model of the brain. Then, learn how to build and train a network, as well as create a neural network that recognizes numbers coming from a seven-segment display. Even though you'll probably work with neural networks from a software suite rather than by writing your own code, the knowledge you’ll acquire in this course can help you choose the right neural network architecture and training method for each problem you face.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
